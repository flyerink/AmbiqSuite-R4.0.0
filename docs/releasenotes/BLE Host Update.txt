*   Get rid of 500us delay in isr for generating 32M clock to Cooper with a 100-200us longer from 500us to 700us for 32M clock stablized with required accuracy. Cooper won't start any RF activity sooner than about 1.2ms after asserting clock request pin, so we're sure and safe that 32MHz clock can meet PPM requirement 1.2ms after clock request assertion
